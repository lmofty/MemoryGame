Just a memory game.
You need to click the black cards to discover the anime caracters.
If you click 2 cards who are identical, the cards will disappear and you will get a point.
if you will click 2 cards who are different, nothing will happend, you can try again, till you find a match( 2 identical cards ).
to win, you need to find all the cards.
This game is inspired  after a tutorial made by Ania Kubow, i just copy pasted the important things and i made the game cuter with css
